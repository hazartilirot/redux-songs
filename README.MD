There is a first attempt to understand a Redux library. Given a static 
list of songs which can be separately selected. As one clicks on a play 
button a change immediately appears on screen. A user is shown an imitation 
of playing a song. The whole data is wired up by means of Redux. The 
project implemented in the middle of learning process while watching Modern 
React with Redux course by Stephen Grider.
